PES Tools
=========

This is a library for reading/writing several file formats for Pro Evolution Soccer (2008-2013) like KTMDL (3D), DPOW (2D).

Dependencies:	- MiscUtils.dll (for BigEndian support - Xbox360/PS3)
	- FreeImageNET.dll (for image manipulation)
	
Both DLLs are available on the References folder

The code is quite messy and it doesn't have comments. I have been working on it since the first PES Stadium Studio (2008) and it's not really well coded.
